<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Cylinders</li><li>Double-Acting Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air cylinders market consists mainly of two types: single-acting and double-acting cylinders. Single-acting cylinders use air pressure to extend the piston, while a spring or gravity returns it to its original position, making them simple and cost-effective for lightweight applications. In contrast, double-acting cylinders utilize air pressure for both extending and retracting the piston, providing greater force and control, suitable for more demanding industrial tasks. Both types are essential in automation, manufacturing, and material handling sectors.</p></p>
