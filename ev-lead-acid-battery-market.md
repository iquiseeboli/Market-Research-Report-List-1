<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EV Lead Acid Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealed</li><li>Flooded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EV lead-acid battery market primarily consists of two types: sealed and flooded batteries. Sealed lead-acid batteries are maintenance-free and designed to prevent electrolyte leakage, making them ideal for electric vehicles where safety and convenience are priorities. Flooded lead-acid batteries, on the other hand, require regular maintenance and ventilation due to their liquid electrolyte. While they typically offer higher discharge rates and lower upfront costs, their maintenance needs and susceptibility to spillage can limit their application in EVs.</p></p>
